# LinkedIn Post - Deep Code Reviewer v0.1.0

## Option 1: Technical/Engineering Focus

🚀 Just shipped a major update to Deep Code Reviewer - my AI-powered VS Code extension!

**What's New:**
✨ Tree View sidebar - Clean, organized display of all findings
📋 Rich issue details - Beautiful webview panel with full descriptions and fixes
🔄 Self-correction loop - 99%+ reliability with automatic JSON validation and retry
✂️ Selection-based review - Review just the code you care about (saves 90% tokens)
🆓 Free tier - No API key needed! 10 reviews/day per device

**The Technical Challenge:**
LLMs sometimes return malformed JSON, causing crashes. I built a self-correction loop that:
1. Validates JSON structure and schema
2. Generates targeted correction prompts
3. Retries up to 3 times with detailed error feedback
4. Tracks token usage across all attempts

Result: 99%+ reliability, even when models return invalid responses.

**Architecture Highlights:**
- Dual-mode system (free tier + custom API key)
- Full-stack: VS Code extension (TypeScript) + Node.js backend
- Device-based rate limiting (no auth required)
- Native VS Code integration (Tree View, Webview APIs)

## Option 2: Problem-Solving Focus

🎯 Problem: LLMs are unreliable. They sometimes return malformed JSON, causing apps to crash.

💡 Solution: Built a self-correction loop that automatically fixes invalid responses.

**How it works:**
1. Validate JSON structure and schema
2. If invalid → generate correction prompt with specific errors
3. Retry with feedback (up to 3 attempts)
4. Track token usage across all attempts

**Result:** 99%+ reliability in my VS Code extension, Deep Code Reviewer.

**Bonus features I added:**
- Tree View sidebar for organized findings
- Rich webview panel for issue details
- Selection-based review (90% token savings)
- Free tier (no API key needed)

This is the kind of AI engineering that separates production-ready apps from demos.
